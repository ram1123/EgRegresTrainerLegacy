# EGamma Regression Trainer

This is the E/gamma Energy Regression Trainer used for RunII. It is [RegressionTrainer](https://github.com/cms-egamma/RegressionTrainer>) and [HiggsAnalysis](https://github.com/cms-egamma/HiggsAnalysis>) ported to a common build system.
It links against CMSSW but is otherwise standalone and is not built as part of CMSSW. It is very much a legacy tool and E/gamma wishes to move away from it as quickly as possible. So you have been warned.
