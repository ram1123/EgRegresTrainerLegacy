# EGamma Regression Trainer

The egamma regression training has following steps:

1. Get the input sample for the training
    1. The regression training needs two input root file. One corresponds to the `ideal Intercalibration Constants (IC)` and another for the `real IC`.

    ```{note}
    For run - 3, the raw energy includes both ECAL and PS energy combined. For run - 2 regression, we didn't include the PS energy in the training.
    ```

1. Train the regression and check its performance.
1. Re-validate the training by re-running the HLT step with the updated .db file.
1. Upload the `.db` file having the training information in the Global Tag (GT).
