   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to EGamma Regression's documentation!
=============================================

This is the E/gamma Energy Regression Trainer used for RunII. It is `RegressionTrainer <https://github.com/cms-egamma/RegressionTrainer>`_ and `HiggsAnalysis <https://github.com/cms-egamma/HiggsAnalysis>`_ ported to a common build system.
It links against CMSSW but is otherwise standalone and is not built as part of CMSSW. It is very much a legacy tool and E/gamma wishes to move away from it as quickly as possible. So you have been warned.
